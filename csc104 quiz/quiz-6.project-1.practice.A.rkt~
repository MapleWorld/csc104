; Quiz 6 and Project 1 Practice, Part 1
; =====================================

; Explore the function ‘element?’
; -------------------------------

; A. What error does this following produce:
#;(element?)

; B. Based on the error in part A, why would I try the following expression:
#;(element? 1 2)

; C. Based on the error you get when you try the expression from part B,
;     why would I try an expression with the following form:
#;(element? 1 ___)

; D. Replace the ‘___’ in the expression from part C so it doesn't produce an error.

; E. Find the description for ‘element?’ in the csc104 language documentation.

; F. Replace ‘___’ in the following check-expects so that they pass:
#;(check-expect (element? 123 ___) #true)
#;(check-expect (element? 123 ___) #false)

; Design a function that uses ‘element?’
; --------------------------------------

(define zoo (list "eel" "fly" "bee"))

; Here are some tests for a unary predicate zoo-animal? : any → boolean .
; The predicate determines whether a value is in the zoo list.
#;(check-expect (zoo-animal? "fly") #true)
#;(check-expect (zoo-animal? "dog") #false)
#;(check-expect (zoo-animal? "eel") #true)

; Write a full Design check-expect for zoo-animal?, using the zoo list:



; Define zoo-animal? accordingly:




; Use the function ‘zoo-animal?’
; ------------------------------

(define animals (list "ant" "bee" "cat" "dog" "eel"))

; For each of the following check-expects, replace ‘animals’ with an
;  expression that uses ‘animals’ and makes the check-expect pass:

#;(check-expect animals
              (list #false  #true #false  #false  #true))

#;(check-expect animals
              (list #;"ant" "bee" #;"cat" #;"dog" "eel"))
